# Day 1 - DevOps Journey

## What I Learned Today
- DevOps is a culture that combines Development and Operations
- It focuses on automation, deployment, and system reliability
- Linux is important because most servers run on Linux

## Commands I Practiced
- pwd (shows current directory)
- ls (lists files)
- whoami (shows current user)
- mkdir (create directory)
- touch (create file)

## My Reflection
Today I set up my Linux environment and learned basic terminal commands.
This is my first step towards becoming a DevOps Engineer by August 2026.
