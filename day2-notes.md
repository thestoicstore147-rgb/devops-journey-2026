# Day 2 - How the Internet Works

## What I Learned
- DNS converts domain names into IP addresses
- TCP establishes reliable connections
- HTTPS encrypts communication
- Servers process remote requests
- Git push travels through multiple network layers

## Commands Practiced
- ping github.com
- nslookup github.com
- traceroute github.com
- curl ifconfig.me

## Reflection
Today I understood how my terminal communicates with remote servers like GitHub through DNS, TCP, and HTTPS.
