# DevOps Journey 2026 🚀

## About This Repository
This repository documents my daily journey of learning DevOps and Python from scratch with a structured plan until August 2026.

### What I Learned:

### Practical Work Done:
- Installed Linux (WSL/Ubuntu)
- Created markdown notes using terminal

## Goal:
To become a job-ready DevOps Engineer by August 2026 through daily consistent practice and real-world projects.
