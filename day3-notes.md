# Day 3 - Linux File System & Permissions

## What I Learned
- Linux uses a tree file system starting from root (/)
- Navigation commands: cd, pwd, ls
- File operations: cp, mv, rm, touch
- Permissions system (r, w, x)
- chmod controls file access security

## Commands Practiced
- cd /
- ls -l
- chmod 777
- cp, mv, rm
- mkdir and touch

## Reflection
Today I learned how Linux organizes files and how permissions control access. This is important for servers and DevOps environments.
